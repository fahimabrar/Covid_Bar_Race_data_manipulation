### Covid Bar Race 
Hi! I want  to make a bar chart race, comparing number of covid patient in different countries with time. I collected the dataset from microsoft bing covid [data](https://github.com/microsoft/Bing-COVID-19-Data/tree/master/data). 

For bar race I used flourish website. To feed data on this website I need to manipulate raw data that I got from bing website. 

The manipulation is mainly dropping some unnecessary column and convert dataset in a way so that the date of data collection in column name

### Library Needed
- Pandas
